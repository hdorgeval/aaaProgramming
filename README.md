# aaaProgramming

This project is the code companion of the book [aaaProgramming for .Net Developers](https://www.gitbook.com/book/aaaprogramming/aaa-programming-pour-les-developpeurs-net/details).

This project contains a set of Framework Extensions for the .Net Framework 3.5 ( These Framework Extensions will be also provided for the Framework 4.0 and above as soon the version for the .Net 3.5 is released).

This set of Framework Extensions will help you make a cleaner code and will also help you deliver high quality code more rapidly.

The library Documentation and Specification is provided by Sandcastle and Specflow.

This library is also published as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aaaProgramming.Framework3.5Extensions)
